- Show a screenshot of the code change diff from Github (a page like this)
- Link to the test file for a failure-inducing input that prompted you to make that change
- Show the symptom of that failure-inducing input by showing the output of running the file at the command line for the version where it was failing (this should also be in the commit message history)
- Write 2-3 sentences describing the relationship between the bug, the symptom, and the failure-inducing input.
